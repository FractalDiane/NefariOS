Entry 31
////////////////////////////////////////

Deep inside I am sure sure they felt my 
pain. Though probably not very deep as a
matter of fact. Just a shallow point of
two. Those two points were indeed my 
point of interest, but that point of 
interest was far less than what was 
actually there. The gold within the 
mine. And it was the gold that was all 
mine. But that of which I call mine,
little remains in the household that I
would call mine. 

This computer is mine, that much I can 
confirm.
