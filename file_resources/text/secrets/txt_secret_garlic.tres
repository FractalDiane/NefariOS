text = "I've heard that to some, cilantro tastes
like soap. Recently, I've come to learn
that garlic also has a soapy taste. I
discovered this when some friends told
me to try adding it to a pasta dish. I
didn't add much, but it was enough to
make me vomit. I brought this up with
mother and she looked at me with
disappointed eyes, and stated that this
was common sense among us.

No one ever told me about this, but this
experience was enough to traumatize me.
