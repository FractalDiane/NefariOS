Mother wouldn't really let me go because
she said I would fit in. As much time
passed, I began to understand what she
meant by that. For us, time doesn't pass
at the same rate as them. So then I
asked mother, why don't we have a school
just for people like us? I never got an
answer from her. Maybe someday I'll
experience what it's like to be in
school."
