Everyone hates it, though. It uses a graph-based structure instead of a hierarchial one. You can't go back up to a previous directory; you have to find another way back to it. I'm sure you'll manage.

The virus is spreading fast, and it's gonna corrupt this whole computer before too long. It'll advance as you open more folders.

Just find those files I told you to find and get them the hell off this computer. And DON'T OPEN THE FILES I TOLD YOU NOT TO. You'll be sorry.
