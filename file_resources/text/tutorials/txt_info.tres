I told you to find and get them the hell off this computer.
They're on the sticky note.

The virus is spreading fast, and it's 
gonna corrupt this whole computer 
before too long. It'll advance as you 
go into more folders.

Also, yes. This computer runs NefariOS.
Don't judge my operating system tastes.

Everyone hates it, though. It uses a 
graph-based structure instead of a 
hierarchial one. You can't go back up to
a previous directory; you have to find 
another way back to it. I'm sure you'll 
manage.
 
One more time: DON'T OPEN THE FILES I TOLD
YOU NOT TO. You'll be sorry.
