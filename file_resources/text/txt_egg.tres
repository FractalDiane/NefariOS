text = "Optional: Poke a very small hole on the 
bottom of the egg. This will allow water
to enter the egg and envelope it for 
easier peeling later.
=== ASIDE ==========
Stick a thumbtack through the bottom of
your egg carton, with the pointy part 
sticking up where an egg should be. 
Hold the carton still and gently press 
the egg down onto the thumbtack.
==== END ASIDE =====
Pour water into a small pot, enough to 
cover an egg if one were to place one 
in. Place on stove at high heat and 
cover with lid to increase heat faster.

Wait for water to come to a rolling 
boil. It should be rapidly boiling with 
large bubbles with no further changes in
boiling pattern. Set a timer for 5 
minutes.

Gently lower the egg into the pot of 
water with a sturdy utensil.
If poked a hole, gently stir the water 
with the egg for about 10 seconds to 
encourage water to flow into the egg.

Once timer goes off, immediately take 
off the heat and strain into the sink.

Using cold water, run it over the egg
while in the pot to cool it down. 
Continue for about 30 seconds. This 
shocks the egg and contracts the egg 
from the shell to make it easier to 
peel.

Peel the egg. I suggest gently cracking 
the egg all around, then under cool 
running water, peel. Be gentle as this 
is a soft boiled egg; the yolk is soft 
and has little structure.

If the egg is broken, salvage what 
remains. Unsalvageable toppings can 
simply be excluded from the final ramen 
if desired.

Set aside for later use."
