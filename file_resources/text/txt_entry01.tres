I know words, I have words, like there was once a time when  
it was. By the way, but today I am me. For me, I am just  
myself today. Today with a cup of water. Water, yes. Today I 
have water. Today, everything is fine. Everything is just  
fine, nothing happened today that I am to write in this  
entry of my day. This is entry 1, my first entry for these  
entries I am to do.

I am.
