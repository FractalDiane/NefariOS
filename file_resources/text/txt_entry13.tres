ENTRY 13
////////////////////////////////////////

Today my friend told me I was mad. But mad was they were telling me I was mad. Mad I was after they told me I was mad. To be mad is an extremely maddening damnation. I am not mad, for I am not. The table had not been replaced recently, so I am not mad. The door, too, had not been replaced. Outside had not been replaced. Nothing had been replaced? Will I be replaced? Replaced by whom? I replace something else? I replace and they replace. Why care of input if output is the same?
