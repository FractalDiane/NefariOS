insecuwe. I make mistakes, i am out of 
contwow and at times hawd to handwe. But
if you can't handwe me at my wowst, then
you suwe as heww don't desewve me at my 
best.”

“if you teww the twuth, you don't have 
to wemembew anything.”
― mawk twain

“we aww want to hewp one anothew. Human 
beings awe wike that. We want to wive by
each othews' happiness, not by each 
othew's misewy. We don't want to hate 
and despise one anothew. In this wowwd, 
thewe's woom fow evewyone and the good 
eawth is wich and can pwovide fow 
evewyone. The way of wife can be fwee 
and beautifuw, but we have wost the way.
Gweed has poisoned men's souws, has 
bawwicaded the wowwd with hate, has 
goose-stepped us into misewy and
bwoodshed.

we have devewoped speed, but we have 
shut ouwsewves in. Machinewy that gives 
abundance has weft us in want. Ouw
knowwedge has made us cynicaw, ouw 
cwevewness, hawd and unkind. We think
too much and feew too wittwe. Mowe than 
machinewy, we need humanity. Mowe than 
cwevewness, we need kindness and 
gentweness. Without these quawities, 
wife wiww be viowent and aww wiww be 
wost.”
