by James Winter

Masochism.

This word gets thrown around a lot, but I don't think it applies anywhere as aptly as here. Nobody asked me to spend an entire week with this GARBAGE operating system. Nobody asked me to do this review. I just decided to do it myself, because I hate being happy. And I challenge anyone to be happy while using NefariOS.

You can buy this operating system for $150 (!!!) from pretty much any computer store. They're really trying to get it out there, so they're just stuffing the store shelves with it everywhere you can look. Maybe they're trying to make it look like a successful product by showing how much influence they have? If so, they're doing a bad job.

So, the big headline feature of NefariOS? Mouse support. MOUSE SUPPORT! WOW, GUYS, THAT'S JUST AMAZING!

Yeah. No.

You can use a mouse, if you're forward-thinking enough to own one, in all areas of the operating system, not just in applications but also in the command line. This lets you select things just by clicking on them, instead of having to remember and type those horrible, horrible DOS commands. (I promise, they aren't that hard to remember, and typing is great. If you have a Model M.)"
